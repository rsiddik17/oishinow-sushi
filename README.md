# **OishiNow - Sushi Website**

This project is built using Vite, with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I created this project as a learning exercise to explore and apply several fundamental web development techniques:

  - Using CSS variables to manage design tokens and themes
  - Importing one CSS file into another for better modular styling
  - Applying flexbox and positioning properties to structure layouts
  - Creating smooth and subtle animations for better user experience
  - Following the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for CSS class names
  - Organizing files and folders in a clean, maintainable way
  - Practicing the principles of writing clean and readable code
